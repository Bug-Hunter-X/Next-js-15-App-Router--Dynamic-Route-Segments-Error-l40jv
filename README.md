# Next.js 15 App Router Dynamic Route Segments Error

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Next.js 15 App Router when using dynamic route segments in the `pages` directory.  The error message is unhelpful and the resolution requires restructuring the application. 

## Bug Description

When using dynamic route segments like `pages/[id].js`, the app router throws an unexpected error that prevents the application from rendering correctly. The error message does not provide clear guidance on resolving the issue.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error in the console and the application failure to render.

## Solution

The solution involves restructuring the application to follow best practices for the new app router or to avoid dynamic route segments in the `pages` directory.

## Additional Notes

This bug highlights a potential challenge in migrating applications to the new Next.js 15 App Router, particularly those using dynamic routes in the pages directory.  Clearer error messages and enhanced documentation for dealing with such scenarios are crucial for smoother adoption.
